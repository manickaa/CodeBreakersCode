    if not head or not head.next:

#O(N) - Linear time
#   Explanation:
#   When there is no cycle, each node is traversed exactly once - O(N)
#   When there is a cycle, the slow pointer goes through all the nodes that are not in the cycle N (non-cyclic length)
#                          the fast pointer goes (distance between two pointers / difference of speed) loops in order to catch up with slow pointer - K (cyclic length)
#                           O(N+K) => O(N)


#O(1) - Constant space
#We use only two pointers here
